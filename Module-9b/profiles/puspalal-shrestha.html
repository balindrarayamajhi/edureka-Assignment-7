                    Pushpa Lal Shrestha (Nepali: पुष्पलाल श्रेष्ठ) was a Nepali politician. He was the founding general secretary of the Communist Party of Nepal as well as the party's leader.

                    Shrestha played a large role in the early years of the Communist Party. The party split in 1962. He followed the radical sector led by Tulsi Lal Amatya in forming a separate Communist Party. Its 3rd congress in 1962 declared that Tulsi Lal and Pushpa
                    Lal would share the central leadership responsibilities.

                In 1968, as the Sino-Soviet split intensified, the power-sharing agreement with Tulsi Lal Amatya was failing. Pushpa left with a largely Maoist contingent to form the Communist Party of Nepal (Pushpa Lal). He remained its leader until his death in 1978.
                He became an inspiration for other Communists, such as Prachanda.

                    Pushpa Lal was married to Sahana Pradhan (1927-2014), who became leader of the party from 1986.t.
